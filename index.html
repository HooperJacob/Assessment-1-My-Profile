  <h2>Personal Information</h2>

      <p>My name is Jacob, I'm 26, born in Australia, lived in Tasmania all of my life until 2019 when I moved to Brisbane. I speak English, however I studied Japanese in my senior high school years, and it's something I'd like to pursue after I finish my studies at RMIT. I finished highschool and went in and out of jobs, till I re-skilled myself with a Certificate III in Aged Care, which is currently what I'm doing casually along side my studies. I tried a Certificate III in IT in TAFE, but decided that it was not fitting in the current time frame of life goals that I have. I love CCGs(Collectable Card Games) such as Magic; as well as many different video games, and reading.

      <h2>How my interest in IT started</h2>
      <p>My interest in information technology is in helping other people learn IT and helping them to understand it better, whether it is hardware or software, and learning about new technology that can improve my life and my interests/hobbies. My fascination for technology started when my nan got me a Gameboy pocket for Christmas as a kid, and my passion for all things tech blossomed from there.</p>
      <p>A recent experience that sparked my interest in helping other people while in my role as an Assistant in Nursing(AIN), in Aged Care. Currently, there is a massive disconnect in the Aged Care industry with the progression of IT and it’s use for documentation, and the experience levels of a large number of workers in the industry. To clarify, there is a lack of training and experience for some senior nurses and carers, as up until recently a lot of the documentation was in paper form.</p>
      <p>I found that I really enjoyed helping people understand the new technology in the workplace through using terminology they understood in order to do the documentation digitally.</p>
      <p>I chose to come to RMIT as Open Universities offered this undergraduate course, and it was the only one that fit the time period I wanted to commence study in. I expect to learn multiple different facets of technology and how to use them, as well as their effects on society, and the ramifications of their presence in our modern world. After graduating, I plan to work my way into the Information Technology sector in any form, using my degree to start building the foundations of a stronger, more exciting career.</p>

    <h2>Junior IT Support & Implementations Assistant</h2>

    <a href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/51768302?type=standard#searchRequestToken=f1e8735d-01dd-4c38-bf0c-1b8de24ffc67">Job Link</a></p>
    <p>This position is a junior position for a recent tertiary IT graduate. It is full time, and it focuses on strong customer service, communication and business acumen. This is particularly appealing to me, as it is junior position in IT that suits a recent graduate.</p>
    <p> I like it because it would allow me to get into the industry in a support/assistant role. I could then use that position to gain experience and training, and pursue strong, meaningful career development in an IT role.</p>
    <p>The listed job requires at least one year of experience In IT, as well as experience working in a customer service based role.</p>
    <p>Some of the listed personal skills that are required</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Strong problem solving and trouble shooting skills</li>
        <li>Aptitude for learning and applying technologies to business problems</li>
        <li>Strong written and verbal skills</li>
        <li>Exceptional time management skills</li>
        <li>Team player mentality</li>
      </ul>
    <p>Some of the technical skills listed:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Experience with programming languages</li>
        <li>Experience with tools like Excel or Power BI</li>
        <li>Experience with VBA</li>
        <li>An understanding of networking</li>
        <li>An understanding of relational databases</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Currently, I do not have IT industry experience listed in the role, and I have not graduated from my tertiary study. However, I have plenty of customer service experience in the form of my work in Aged Care as an AIN agency worker. Being an agency worker, one of the fundamental facets of my job is learning to quickly and effectively mesh into a new team environment, potentially every new shift, if I work at a new facility.</p>
      <p>As such, I already have experience in using problem solving to fit into workplaces, as well as proven time management and team player mentality. As I progress through my tertiary study, I can hone my verbal and written communication to a level that is sought after in a professional setting, as well as learning technology for relevant business applications.</p>
      <p>As far as technical skills go, as the role listed recent graduates as suitable, I believe that the majority of the technical skills and expertise would come from my studies. But, if this were not enough to fill the criteria for technical capacity, I would seek out another entry level role, to gain more skills and experience in order to better fit the needs of the role.</p>

        <p>The results of these personality tests do not mean much to me, because they are not fully accurate workplace performance identifiers. Most of the results of these tests have results that change day to day and hold no real accuracy because they have not got any method of proper testing thresholds, like a level of candidness. <a href="https://hbr.org/2014/08/the-problem-with-using-personality-tests-for-hiring">Marten(2014) </a> </p>
        <p>I don’t think a learning test is an accurate metric for workplace traits either, as everyone is expected to perform their tasks accordingly, regardless of the methods used in training and learning. It could affect the training process, but I don’t think that an organisation would be willing to spend the extra resources to design catered training and learning for specific learning types.</p>
        <p>However, I do understand the appeal and the usefulness for using these tests in order to thin out the application process and speed it up, which could definitely be desirable for companies with large amounts of applications, with not as much time to sift through each application.</p>
        <p>That being said, when someone tries to be as truthful as possible, they can provide some insight into your personality, to a degree.</p>
        <p>I do not think the results of these tests would change the way that I behave in a team, because the way I behave in a team environment is based on my work ethics, drive and choices, not the results of tests regarding my learning, personality or anything else.</p>
        <p>As far as results are concerned for team capacity, my Big 5 test showed high scores in all but extraversion, which could suggest I have more shut-in like tendencies. This could be something I should be mindful of, making sure to have extra diligence when It comes to communication with my team, making sure that they understand that even though I can be reserved, this will not impact on the ability for me to work in a team orientated setting, and that I am willing to put in the work and effort to maintaining a healthy, well communicated team environment. </p>

        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>An all-purpose, evolving database software for the Aged Care system, focused more on speed of access and ease of use. Ideally a sponsored, central system to be used and distributed by the government, allowing for consistency and ease of access for doctors across homes, as well as allowing for proper regulation of subsidy funding.</p>
        <p>The current issue with a lot of database software used in the Aged Care sector, is that it is not user friendly for the average user in the industry.</p>
        <p>Quite a large amount of the Carers and Nurses have not got much technical knowhow, being from an industry that was largely paper focused for their medical records. In some facilities, the change to digital documentation has not been pushed hard until the last 5 years, and even then; some facilities still use paper records in some scenarios when programs fail.</p>

        <h2>Motivation</h2>
        <p>This leads into my motivation for creating this program, to solve some of the problems that the personnel in the Aged Care industry face. As I am actually an agency AIN (Assist Nurse), so I actually have experience in the sector, and it is one of the main reasons for my drive to improve the industry through better technological improvement.</p>
        <p>My major motivation for creating the software, is making it more time efficient, as well as being more user friendly. More and more people are entering the sector at older ages, with much higher needs for their cares. This is where more efficient database software comes in.  With more and more high needs care patients coming in, the amount of time needed to perform their cares will marginally increase in time.</p>
        <p>However, quite a few of these programs have not shown increases in efficiency, or integration of modern smart technologies that other sectors are finding positive benefits of.</p>
        <h2>Project Description</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Voice to text integration for taking notes, and inputting data. Even some of the best nurses and carers, with excellent time management skills struggle if they have a time-consuming shift due to unforeseen complications. Being able to have voice to text technology in order to save time would be a major benefit for the system as a whole. Rather than inputting the medical data for each resident at the end of the shift/or when you have time, by streamlining some of the process to be voice to text, it could drastically reduce the amount of time spent on paperwork and allow for more time spent with residents.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Voice command integration. Similar to popular virtual personal assistants, the program will have basic voice commands in order to facilitate faster operations, with more convenience. Such as pulling medical records to your screen with a voice command or sending messages to doctors about changes in a resident’s health, a lot faster. </li>
            <br>
            <li>Simpler, streamlined user interfacing to complement voice to text software, enabling workers to save time inputting information in order to provide higher quality care. An issue some facilities have is lack of data input for medical records, due to lack of experience with the technology needed to input it, or flat-out refusal because carers don’t like the systems in place. By taking the time to design an interface for aged care workers that aren’t so confident with technology, facilities can up the amount of funding they receive by submitting better, more consistent documentation.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Proper smart technology integration would be another important feature of the software. While not all facilities may not have the money required to outfit their workplaces with the most modern technology, it’s important to have the integration of smart hardware going forward into the future. As time progresses, more and more innovations are going to be made with technologies, such as smarter GPS devices for those residents who wander their facilities, as well as current innovations, such as the Gaspard pad for wheelchairs. Integration with technology like this could allow for automated pressure documentation, which is currently something that has to be monitored and documented manually into databases.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Proper tutorials and education resources. So many services don’t have ready access to tutorials teaching their users how to use their software, outside of proper training. By creating tutorials that are designed for those with lack of experience in mind, it would allow for less time spent with staff confused or having to ask IT personnel how to fix common problems.</li>
            <br>
            <li>App integration is something else that would be a strong possibility as a feature for the program. One of the major downfalls of a lot of the hardware and software, is that the developers are greedy, and lack foresight for technological integration of their respective technologies. By allowing app functionality, ease of download for hardware that is commonly found in aged care facilities is achieved, so that no special, gimmicky hardware that is too niche for anything else has to be purchased. Another benefit, is that workers could download the software and have a login feature, even further reducing the hardware costs, and increasing accessibility for the people who use the software.</li>
          </ul>
          <h2>Resources needed - Tools and Technologies</h2>
          <p>The software needed to code the program would require the language to have the ability to program voice recognition software, as well as create complex database software, storing sometimes over one hundred resident’s medical records, as well as other relevant information. Ideally, if the software could be created as an app for smart devices, such as Apple or Android software, this would allow the program to bypass the need for unique hardware. The software could also potentially benefit from the use of AI to regulate and find better ways to process the data involved, speeding up the software through establishing trends and other important information. Another important technology needed for such sensitive information is data encryption, as it is extremely sensitive info being supplied into the data base.</p>
          <h2>Skills Required</h2>
          <p>The skills required for the programming of this app would be proficient database knowledge, as well as understanding virtual assistant programs that use voice technologies. Another important skill would be the need to communicate with and understand the target audiences needs for the program, as it is designed with people have less experience with technology as a whole. The writer of the software would also need extensive cross platform knowledge, being a program targeted at multiple platforms and hardware types.</p>
          <h2>Outcome</h2>
          <p>If this software project was successful, it would help improve the time management, and the ergonomics of the Aged Care industry immensely. By cutting down on the time needed for data input, there could be so much more quality time given to those who need it. As the amount of high care residents increase in the Aged Care industry, reducing the time spent on paperwork would alleviate the stress placed on those working in it. Another effect of the success of this technology will be that having a higher input of documentation through ease of access, the amount of funding for each facility will increase, allowing for more resources to be allocated for a higher level of care.</p>
