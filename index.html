      <p>My name is Jacob, I'm 26, born in Australia, lived in Tasmania all of my life until 2019 when I moved to Brisbane. I speak English, however I studied Japanese in my senior high school years, and it's something I'd like to pursue after I finish my studies at RMIT. I finished highschool and went in and out of jobs, till I re-skilled myself with a Certificate III in Aged Care, which is currently what I'm doing casually along side my studies. I tried a Certificate III in IT in TAFE, but decided that it was not fitting in the current time frame of life goals that I have. I love CCGs(Collectable Card Games) such as Magic; as well as many different video games, and reading.

    <h2>How my Interest in IT started</h2>
      <p>My interest in information technology is in helping other people learn IT and helping them to understand it better, whether it is hardware or software, and learning about new technology that can improve my life and my interests/hobbies. My interest started in technology started when my nan got me a GameBoy Pocket for Christmas as a kid, and my passion for all things tech blossomed from there.</p>

      <p>A recent experience that sparked my interest in helping other people while in my role as an Assistant in Nursing, in Aged Care. Currently there is a massive disconnect in the Aged Care industry with the progression of IT and it’s use for documentation, and the experience levels of a large amount of workers in the industry. What I mean by this, is lack of training and experience for senior nurses and carers, as up until recently a lot of the documentation was in paper form.<p>
      <p>I found that I really enjoyed helping people understand the new technology in the workplace through using terminology they understood in order to do the documentation digitally.</p>
      <p>I chose to come to RMIT as Open Universities offered this undergraduate course, and it was the only one that fit the time period I wanted to commence study in. I expect to learn multiple different facets of technology and how to use them, as well as their effects on society, and the ramifications of their presence in our modern world. After graduating, I plan to work my way into the Information Technology sector in any form, using my degree to start building the foundations of a stronger, more exciting career.</p>
