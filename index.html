    <p>My interest in information technology is in helping other people learn IT and helping them to understand it better, whether it is hardware or software, and learning about new technology that can improve my life and my interests/hobbies. My interest started in technology started when my nan got me a Gameboy pocket for Christmas as a kid, and my passion for all things tech blossomed from there.</p>

    <p>A recent experience that sparked my interest in helping other people while in my role as an Assistant in Nursing, in Aged Care. Currently there is a massive disconnect in the Aged Care industry with the progression of IT and it’s use for documentation, and the experience levels of a large amount of workers in the industry. What I mean by this, is lack of training and experience for senior nurses and carers, as up until recently a lot of the documentation was in paper form.<p>
