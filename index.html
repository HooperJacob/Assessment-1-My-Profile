      <p>My name is Jacob, I'm 26, born in Australia, lived in Tasmania all of my life until 2019 when I moved to Brisbane. I speak English, however I studied Japanese in my senior high school years, and it's something I'd like to pursue after I finish my studies at RMIT. I finished highschool and went in and out of jobs, till I re-skilled myself with a Certificate III in Aged Care, which is currently what I'm doing casually along side my studies. I tried a Certificate III in IT in TAFE, but decided that it was not fitting in the current time frame of life goals that I have. I love CCGs(Collectable Card Games) such as Magic; as well as many different video games, and reading.

    <h2>How my Interest in IT started</h2>
      <p>My interest in information technology is in helping other people learn IT and helping them to understand it better, whether it is hardware or software, and learning about new technology that can improve my life and my interests/hobbies. My interest started in technology started when my nan got me a GameBoy Pocket for Christmas as a kid, and my passion for all things tech blossomed from there.</p>

      <p>A recent experience that sparked my interest in helping other people while in my role as an Assistant in Nursing, in Aged Care. Currently there is a massive disconnect in the Aged Care industry with the progression of IT and it’s use for documentation, and the experience levels of a large amount of workers in the industry. What I mean by this, is lack of training and experience for senior nurses and carers, as up until recently a lot of the documentation was in paper form.<p>
      <p>I found that I really enjoyed helping people understand the new technology in the workplace through using terminology they understood in order to do the documentation digitally.</p>
      <p>I chose to come to RMIT as Open Universities offered this undergraduate course, and it was the only one that fit the time period I wanted to commence study in. I expect to learn multiple different facets of technology and how to use them, as well as their effects on society, and the ramifications of their presence in our modern world. After graduating, I plan to work my way into the Information Technology sector in any form, using my degree to start building the foundations of a stronger, more exciting career.</p>

    <h2>Junior IT Support & Implementations Assistant</h2>

    <a href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/51768302?type=standard#searchRequestToken=f1e8735d-01dd-4c38-bf0c-1b8de24ffc67">Job Link</a></p>
    <p>This position is a junior position for a recent tertiary IT graduate. It is full time, and it focuses on strong customer service, communication and business acumen. This is particularly appealing to me, as it is junior position in IT that suits a recent graduate.</p>
    <p> I like it because it would allow me to get into the industry in a support/assistant role. I could then use that position to gain experience and training, and pursue strong, meaningful career development in an IT role.</p>
    <p>The job requires at least one year of experience, as well as experience working in a customer experience role are listed under the required experience for the job.</p>
    <p>Some of the listed personal skills that are required</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Strong problem solving and trouble shooting skills</li>
        <li>Aptitude for learning and applying technologies to business problems</li>
        <li>Strong written and verbal skills</li>
        <li>Exceptional time management skills</li>
        <li>Team player mentality</li>
      </ul>
    <p>Some of the technical skills listed:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Experience with programming languages</li>
        <li>Experience with tools like Excel or Power BI</li>
        <li>Experience with VBA</li>
        <li>An understanding of networking</li>
        <li>An understanding of relational databases</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Currently, I do not have IT industry experience listed in the role, and I have not graduated from my tertiary study. However, I have plenty of customer service experience in the form of my work in Aged Care as an AIN agency worker. Being an agency worker, one of the fundamental facets of my job is learning to quickly and effectively mesh into a new team environment, potentially every new shift, if I work at a new facility.</p>
      <p>As such, I already have experience in using problem solving to fit into workplaces, as well as proven time management and team player mentality. As I progress through my tertiary study, I can hone my verbal and written communication to a level that is sought after in a professional setting, as well as learning technology for relevant business applications.</p>
      <p>As far as technical skills go, as the role listed recent graduates as suitable, I believe that the majority of the technical skills and expertise would come from my studies. But, if this were not enough to fill the criteria for technical capacity, I would seek out another entry level role, to gain more skills and experience in order to better fit the needs of the role.</p>

<h1>Test Results:</h1>

        <p>The results of these personality tests do not mean much to me, because they are not fully accurate workplace performance identifiers. Most of the results of these tests have results that change day to day and hold no real accuracy because they have not got any method of proper testing thresholds, like a level of candidness. <a href="https://hbr.org/2014/08/the-problem-with-using-personality-tests-for-hiring">Marten(2014) </a> </p>
        <p>I don’t think a learning test is an accurate metric for workplace traits either, as everyone is expected to perform their tasks accordingly, regardless of the methods used in training and learning. It could affect the training process, but I don’t think that an organisation would be willing to spend the extra resources to design catered training and learning for specific learning types.</p>
        <p>However, I do understand the appeal and the usefulness for using these tests in order to thin out the application process and speed it up, which could definitely be desirable for companies with large amounts of applications, with not as much time to sift through each application.</p>
        <p>That being said, when someone tries to be as truthful as possible, they can provide some insight into your personality, to a degree.</p>
        <p>I do not think the results of these tests would change the way that I behave in a team, because the way I behave in a team environment is based on my work ethics, drive and choices, not the results of tests regarding my learning, personality or anything else.</p>
        <p>As far as results are concerned for team capacity, my Big 5 test showed high scores in all but extraversion, which could suggest I have more shut-in like tendencies. This could be something I should be mindful of, making sure to have extra diligence when It comes to communication with my team, making sure that they understand that even though I can be reserved, this will not impact on the ability for me to work in a team orientated setting, and that I am willing to put in the work and effort to maintaining a healthy, well communicated team environment. </p>
