<h1>About me</h1>
<br>
<p>My interest in information technology is in helping other people learn IT and helping them to understand it better, whether it is hardware or software, and learning about new technology that can improve my life and my interests/hobbies. My interest started in technology started when my nan got me a Gameboy pocket for Christmas as a kid, and my passion for all things tech blossomed from there. </p>
